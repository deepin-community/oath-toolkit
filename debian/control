Package: liboath-dev
Section: libdevel
Architecture: any
Multi-Arch: same
Depends: liboath0 (= ${binary:Version}), ${misc:Depends}
Description: Development files for the OATH Toolkit Liboath library
 OATH Toolkit provide components to build one-time password
 authentication systems.  It contains shared C libraries, command line
 tools and a PAM module.  Supported technologies include the
 event-based HOTP algorithm (RFC 4226), the time-based TOTP algorithm
 (RFC 6238), and Portable Symmetric Key Container (PSKC, RFC 6030) to
 manage secret key data.  OATH stands for Open AuTHentication, which is
 the organization that specify the algorithms.
 .
 This package contain all files necessary for developing programs that
 use Liboath.
